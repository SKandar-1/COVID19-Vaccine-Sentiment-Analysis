Abstract:

As the delta variant of COVID19 spreads rapidly throughout the world, countries are in a race to vaccinate people sooner than the virus can spread.

Word Cloud of the positive tweets show the words ‘safe’, ‘effective’, ‘good’ whereas that of the negative tweets show the words ‘side effect’, ‘risk’, ‘concern’.
